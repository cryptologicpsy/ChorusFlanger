Chorus/Flanger Effect Plugin
The Chorus/Flanger Effect Plugin is a versatile audio effect that allows you to add rich modulation effects to your audio signals. This plugin offers a range of parameters for fine-tuning your sound, including rate, depth, spread, and mix. Additionally, it provides you with the flexibility to choose between chorus and flanger effects to suit your creative needs.

Key Features
Rate Control: The rate parameter lets you adjust the modulation speed, controlling how quickly the chorus or flanger effect modulates the audio signal.

Depth Adjustment: With the depth control, you can set the intensity of the modulation, influencing the depth of the pitch or time modulation.

Spread Parameter: The spread parameter creates a wide stereo image by controlling the phase relationship between the left and right channels.

Mix Control: The mix parameter allows you to blend the dry (unaffected) and wet (modulated) signals, giving you precise control over the effect's intensity.

Chorus and Flanger Modes: You have the option to select between chorus and flanger effects, providing you with different sonic textures and possibilities.

Upcoming Features
In the near future, we are planning to introduce a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will provide an intuitive and user-friendly way to control all plugin parameters.
